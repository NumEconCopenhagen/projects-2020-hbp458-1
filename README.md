# Exam 2020

This portfolio consists of three projects and an exam answer, furthermore a text file with the groups to which I have given feedback is included.

The first project is the Inaugural Project, that concerns the Labor supply problem. A consumer maximizes over workload and consumption, and the tax is derived from the choices.

The second project is the Data Analysis project, in where I analyse the correlation between birthrate and the GDP pr. capita. The hypothesis is, that higher GDP leads to lower fertility.

The third project is the Model Project, where I have chosen to analyse a Cournot duopoly competition situation. It showshow the cost function affects the marketshare and I end up introducing a third competitor.

In the exam answer the first assignment concerns Linear regression in which OLS and LAD estimation is utilized. The second assignment concerns Durable Purchases where a consumer maximizes value over two periods. The third assignment concerns making an algorithm that optimizes through loops.
