# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Fertility and GDP** and is about the correlation between the 5 year growth of fertility in different agegroups and growth of GDP. The hypothesis is that with growing GDP the fertility in the agespan of 26-40 will increase and fertility of the agespan 15-25 will decrease, as more women will engage in education and make career and thereby postpone childbirth.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [DataAnalysisProject.ipynb](DataAnalysisProject.ipynb).

This **loades two datasets**:

1. FOD33.xlsx downloaded from statistikbanekn.dk/FOD33
1. NAN.xlsx downloaded from statistikbanekn.dk/NAN1

The packages needed to run the project are:

- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
- import numpy as pd
- import pandas as pd
- import ipywidgets as widgets
- import seaborn as sn
