This exam project consists of three assignemnts, each covering different topics in the curriculum.

The first assignment concerns optimization with OLS and LAD and to run the code the following packages are needed:

- import numpy as np
- from numpy.linalg import inv
- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
- from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import *
- from scipy import optimize

The second assignment deal with durable purchases and requires packages not covered in assignment 1:

- from scipy import interpolate

The third assignment concerns gradient descent and is an algorithmically based exercise. This does not need any further packages to be imported.
