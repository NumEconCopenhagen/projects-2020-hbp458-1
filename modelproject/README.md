# Model analysis project

My project is titled Cournot competition and is about solving a market where Cournot competition is present. I start off with two firms with the same cost function in order to establish the groundwork for the further expansion. Thereafter I let the two firms face different cost functions and lastly to spice things up, I introduce a third firm to the market.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [CournotMP.ipynb](CournotMP.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires numpy, matplitlip, sympy and scipy.
